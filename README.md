# Where Am I - Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization
This robotic program localizes a robot inside a given map using Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization technique. The robot and its environment are simulated in gazebo. The robot is equipped with a camera and a LIDAR. The program uses amcl package from ROS Navigation Stack to implent AMCL.

amcl package: [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/amcl), [github](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/tree/melodic-devel/amcl)
